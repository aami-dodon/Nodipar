# Nodipar Alumni Hub

A vibrant, mobile-first alumni experience tailored for reunions, picnics, and lifelong connections. The project now ships as a single-page React + TypeScript application (Vite) that organises every social feature into a dedicated module.

## âœ¨ Highlights
- **Feature-based architecture**: Each capability (Adda Wall, Events Center, BondhoChat, etc.) lives under `frontend/src/features/<feature-name>/`.
- **Modern, vibrant UI**: Gradient surfaces, neon accents, and typography sourced from Poppins + Inter ensure a festival-ready look.
- **Mobile-first layouts**: Every section is designed to stack gracefully on 360px screens before enhancing desktop views.
- **Mock data playground**: `frontend/src/data/mockData.ts` centralises demo content so you can prototype interactions rapidly.
